# Mersenne-Twister pseudorandom number generator in TypeScript

The famous pseudo-random number generator, Mersenne Twister (written in C, [MT.h](https://omitakahiro.github.io/random/code/MT.h)), was translated into TypeScript.
For modern convenience, the data structure has been changed so that generators can be created as instances.
The generator algorithm has not been changed.
